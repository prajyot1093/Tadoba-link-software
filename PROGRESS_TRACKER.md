## 🎯 OVERALL PROGRESS

**Total Commits:** 5 / 30+ (17%)  
**Estimated Time Spent:** 30-45 minutes  
**Estimated Time Remaining:** 20-22 hours

---

## ⚡ CRITICAL PATH ITEMS

### Must Complete Next (Priority Order):
1. ✅ Remove all Replit branding
2. 🔄 **Fix authentication system** (CURRENT)
3. ⏳ Add surveillance feature (8 hours - CRITICAL)
4. ⏳ Deploy to production (2 hours)
5. ⏳ Create demo materials (2 hours)

---

## 🚨 BLOCKERS & RISKS

### Active Blockers:
1. **TypeScript errors in routes.ts** - Need to fix storage methods and type definitions
   - Impact: High
   - ETA to resolve: 30 minutes

### Potential Risks:
1. **Surveillance feature complexity** - May take longer than 8 hours
   - Mitigation: Use TensorFlow.js COCO-SSD instead of YOLO
   - Backup: Simplify to image upload only

2. **Time constraint** - 24 hours is tight
   - Mitigation: Focus on working demo over perfect code
   - Backup: Pre-record video demo

3. **Database not configured** - Still using mock DATABASE_URL
   - Mitigation: Use Neon free tier
   - Backup: Use SQLite for demo

---

## 📝 NOTES & DECISIONS

### Technical Decisions Made:
- ✅ Using JWT instead of Replit Auth
- ✅ Using bcryptjs for password hashing
- ✅ Keeping existing UI/UX design
- ⏳ Need to decide: TensorFlow.js vs YOLOv8 for surveillance

### Files Modified So Far:
- `.gitignore`
- `README.md`
- `AuthVista/.env.example`
- `AuthVista/.env`
- `AuthVista/client/src/pages/animals.tsx`
- `AuthVista/package.json`
- `AuthVista/vite.config.ts`
- `AuthVista/shared/schema.ts`
- `AuthVista/server/routes.ts`
- `AuthVista/server/auth/jwt-auth.ts` (NEW)

### Files Still Need to Modify:
- `AuthVista/server/storage.ts` - Add new methods
- `AuthVista/server/replitAuth.ts` - DELETE THIS FILE
- `AuthVista/client/src/hooks/useAuth.ts` - Update for JWT
- `AuthVista/client/src/pages/landing.tsx` - Update login UI
- All route handlers - Fix type errors

## 💡 TIPS FOR SUCCESS

1. **Commit frequently** - Every 30-60 minutes
2. **Test as you go** - Don't wait until the end
3. **Keep it simple** - Working demo > perfect code
4. **Take breaks** - 5 min every 2 hours
5. **Document progress** - Update this file regularly
