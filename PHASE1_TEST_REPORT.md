## ⚠️ KNOWN ISSUES & LIMITATIONS

### Non-Critical Issues:
1. **Database Connection**: Using mock DATABASE_URL
   - Impact: App won't store data until connected to real DB
   - Fix Time: 15 minutes (use Neon free tier)
   - Priority: Medium

2. **npm Vulnerabilities**: 8 vulnerabilities (3 low, 5 moderate)
   - Impact: Minimal for MVP/demo
   - Fix Time: 10 minutes (`npm audit fix`)
   - Priority: Low

3. **Bundle Size**: Chunks > 500KB
   - Impact: Slightly slower initial load
   - Fix Time: 1 hour (code splitting)
   - Priority: Low

4. **Environment Variables**: Mock values in .env
   - Impact: Must set real values before deployment
   - Fix Time: 5 minutes
   - Priority: High (for deployment)

### Critical Missing Features:
1. **Surveillance System** ❌ (YOUR HACKATHON FOCUS)
   - YOLO/TensorFlow detection

## 📋 DETAILED NEXT STEPS

### Immediate Actions (Next 30 minutes):

```bash
# 1. Install TensorFlow.js packages
cd "C:\Users\prajy\OneDrive\Desktop\Tadoba-link software\AuthVista"
npm install @tensorflow/tfjs-node @tensorflow-models/coco-ssd

# 2. Create surveillance directory structure
mkdir server\surveillance
mkdir client\src\pages\surveillance
mkdir client\src\components\surveillance

# 3. Test TensorFlow installation
npm run check
```

### Step-by-Step Implementation (6-8 hours):

#### Hour 1: Database & API Structure
```typescript
// Add to shared/schema.ts
export const cameras = pgTable("cameras", {
  id: varchar("id").primaryKey(),
  name: varchar("name").notNull(),
  location: varchar("location"),
  latitude: real("latitude"),
  longitude: real("longitude"),
  status: varchar("status").default('active'),
});

export const detections = pgTable("detections", {
  id: varchar("id").primaryKey(),
  cameraId: varchar("camera_id").references(() => cameras.id),
  detectedAt: timestamp("detected_at").defaultNow(),
  objectType: varchar("object_type"), // 'person', 'car', etc.
  confidence: real("confidence"),
  imageUrl: varchar("image_url"),
  boundingBox: jsonb("bounding_box"),
});
```

#### Hour 2-3: Detection Service
```typescript
// server/surveillance/detection-service.ts
import * as cocoSsd from '@tensorflow-models/coco-ssd';
import '@tensorflow/tfjs-node';

export class DetectionService {
  async detectObjects(imageBuffer: Buffer) {
    const model = await cocoSsd.load();
    // Process image and return detections
  }
}
```

#### Hour 4-5: API Endpoints
```typescript
// server/surveillance/routes.ts
app.post('/api/surveillance/process', async (req, res) => {
  // Handle image upload
  // Run detection
  // Save results
  // Trigger alerts if needed
});
```

#### Hour 6-8: Frontend Dashboard
```tsx
// client/src/pages/surveillance/index.tsx
export default function SurveillanceDashboard() {
  return (
    <div>
      <CameraGrid />
      <DetectionMap />
      <AlertsList />
      <Analytics />
    </div>
  );
}
```

## 🎬 RECOMMENDED EXECUTION STRATEGY

### Option A: Focused Sprint (Recommended)
**Time:** 8 hours straight  
**Approach:** Complete surveillance feature fully  
**Risk:** Low  
**Outcome:** Working demo with all core features

### Option B: Parallel Work
**Time:** Distributed over 12 hours  
**Approach:** Work on surveillance + deployment + polish  
**Risk:** Medium  
**Outcome:** More polished but potentially incomplete

### Option C: Minimum Viable
**Time:** 4 hours  
**Approach:** Image upload + detection only (no live camera)  
**Risk:** High (less impressive)  
**Outcome:** Basic working proof-of-concept

## 💡 PRO TIPS FOR NEXT PHASE

### For Fastest Development:
1. **Use existing UI components** - Don't create new ones
2. **Mock camera feeds initially** - Use uploaded images
3. **Start simple** - Single image detection first
4. **Add real-time later** - WebSocket streaming can wait
5. **Focus on demo flow** - Judges see detection → alert → map

### For Hackathon Success:
1. **Commit every 30-45 min** - Show development process
2. **Test after each major change** - Catch bugs early
3. **Document as you go** - Add code comments
4. **Keep backup** - Git branches for risky changes
5. **Demo-driven development** - Build what judges will see

### Emergency Fallbacks:
- **If TensorFlow fails:** Use Roboflow API
- **If real-time fails:** Use image upload only
- **If DB fails:** Use in-memory storage for demo
- **If deployment fails:** Record video demo
