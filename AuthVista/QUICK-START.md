# ðŸŽ¯ QUICK START GUIDE

## To Continue Development, Copy This Prompt:

**"I have a Tadoba Conservation System hackathon project (24 hours, 3.5 hours elapsed). I need you to execute the three-step plan in CONTINUATION-PROMPT.md:**

**STEP 1: Generate a comprehensive progress report showing:**
- All 14 commits completed so far
- Database schema status (8 tables: users, animals, locations, zones, bookings, alerts, cameras, detections)
- All API endpoints working (25+ endpoints including 5 new surveillance endpoints)
- Phase 1 complete (auth + database), Phase 2 at 80% (surveillance backend done, UI pending)
- File changes summary
- Technology stack confirmation
- Current progress metrics (47% complete, 20.5h remaining)

**STEP 2: Comprehensive codebase audit and fix ALL errors:**
- Run TypeScript compilation check, fix all type errors
- Audit server/storage.ts, server/routes.ts, server/db.ts
- Verify surveillance endpoints work correctly
- Fix any SQLite syntax issues
- Test all CRUD operations
- Resolve any warnings or runtime errors
- Verify mock detection service (server/surveillance/mock-detection.ts)
- Test WebSocket alert broadcasting
- Ensure server starts cleanly with 0 errors

**STEP 3A: Frontend customization (ask me for preferences first):**
- Update branding to "Tadoba Conservation System"
- Apply forest green/tiger orange color scheme
- Enhance homepage with hero section
- Add surveillance statistics to dashboard
- Update navigation with Surveillance menu item
- Ask me about: preferred colors, logo, animations, specific UI preferences

**STEP 3B: Execute Phase 2 Surveillance Roadmap (9 commits):**
- Commit #16-17: Surveillance dashboard page with camera grid (2h)
- Commit #18: Camera management (add/edit/delete) (1h)
- Commit #19-20: Image upload interface with bounding box visualization (2.5h)
- Commit #21: Map with camera/detection markers (1.5h)
- Commit #22: Real-time WebSocket alerts with notifications (1.5h)
- Commit #23: Analytics dashboard with charts (2h)
- Commit #24: Settings and configuration panel (1h)

**Follow the detailed roadmap in CONTINUATION-PROMPT.md for exact specifications. Test after each milestone. Create commits as you go. Goal: 30+ commits total, demo-ready app for judges.**

**Start with STEP 1 now.**"

## ðŸ“‹ Current Status Summary:

- **Time**: 3.5h spent / 20.5h remaining
- **Commits**: 14 done / 30+ target
- **Phase 1**: âœ… Complete (Auth + Database)
- **Phase 2**: ðŸŸ¡ 80% (Backend done, UI pending)
- **Server**: Running on port 5000
- **Database**: SQLite with all tables
- **Mock AI**: Detection service ready

## ðŸ”‘ Key Files Created:

- `server/surveillance/mock-detection.ts` - AI simulation
- `server/db.ts` - Cameras & detections tables
- `server/storage.ts` - Surveillance CRUD methods
- `server/routes.ts` - 5 surveillance endpoints
- `test-surveillance.ps1` - API testing script

## ðŸŽ¯ Next Steps:

1. Copy the prompt above to a new chat/session
2. AI will generate progress report
3. AI will audit and fix all code errors
4. AI will ask for your frontend preferences
5. AI will build complete surveillance UI (9 commits)

## ðŸ’¡ Tips:

- Read CONTINUATION-PROMPT.md for full technical details
- Provide feedback during Step 3A customization
- Review each commit as it's created
- Test surveillance features as they're built
- Use test-surveillance.ps1 to verify backend
